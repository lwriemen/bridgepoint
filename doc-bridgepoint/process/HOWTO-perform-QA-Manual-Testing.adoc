= HOWTO Perform BridgePoint QA Manual Testing
:sectnums:
:imagesdir: images

== Abstract

QA Manual Testing is done as part of preparation for a BridgePoint release.
This note describes how to participate in a BridgePoint QA Manual Test cycle.
This includes finding the list of tests designated for the QA manual testing 
cycle, selecting a test to work on, and documenting the result of the test.

:redmine: https://github.com/xtuml/bridgepoint/blob/master/doc-bridgepoint/process/HOWTO-create-bridgepoint-issues.md[HOWTO create BridgePoint issues]

== Getting Ready to Run Manual Tests

. Install the xtUML Modeler Version of BridgePoint by following the
  {bp-install} for installing BridgePoint. The HOWTO document
  contains links to the nightly builds and setup instructions for Windows,
  Linux, and Mac.
. Setup an account on the OneFact issue tracker as detailed in the
  {redmine} for creating BridgePoint issues.
. Clone the https://github.com/xtuml/models[models repository]. This isn't
  necessary for every QA Manual Test, but most of the manual tests use models
  in the repository.


== Finding the QA Manual Tests

Login to the OneFact issue tracker and select Projects, and you'll either be
presented with the <<Home Page>> or the <<Projects Page>>.

.Home Page

.Projects Page
[#image-project]
image::projects_page.png[Projects]

From the <<Home Page>>, select the "Take me right to the BridgePoint issues"
link to go to the <<BridgePoint Project Page>>, or select the Projects link in
the top bar to go to the <<Projects Page>>.

From the <<Projects Page>> select the BridgePoint link to go to the
<<BridgePoint Project Page>>.

.BridgePoint Project Page

The Overview tab should be selected, so select the Issues tab. Notice the list
of issues with a check box, issue number, project name, issue status, and
subject. During the manual test cycle, the QA Manual Tests page will have a 
similar list, as each manual test is written as an issue.

On the right side of the screen, there should be a "Custom Queries" title with
a number of links below it. The QA Manual Tests is one of the custom query 
links. Find it and select it to go to the QA Manual Tests page.

The screenshot of the <<QA Manual Tests Page>> shows what the page looks like
after a release of BridgePoint has been made. The issue list will be populated,
like in the <<BridgePoint Issues Tab>>, before a manual test cycle is started. 
All the QA Manual Test "issues" will have a status of _Acknowledged_.

== Performing the QA Manual Tests

This section is a restatement of the 
https://support.onefact.net/documents/1[Manual QA Test Procedure] found in the
OneFact issue tracker.

. Go to the https://support.onefact.net/projects/qa-manual-tests/issues[QA Manual Tests issues view]
. Pick an issue with a status of _Acknowledged_, change the "Assignee" to
yourself, and change the status to _In Progress_
. Create a new workspace named as the issue number
. Run the test procedure
.. If the test passed
... Change the issue status to _Resolved_
... Change the "Assignee" field to blank
... Add a comment, "Passed for v<version under test>, <OS>" e.g., Passed for v5.0.0,
    Linux Ubuntu 14
... Delete the workspace
.. If the test failed
... Raise a new issue under the BridgePoint project that describes the problem as thoroughly as possible
... In the QA Manual Test issue, add the newly created issue as a _Related issue_
... Add a comment, "Failed for v<version under test>, <OS>" e.g., Failed for
    v5.0.0, Windows 7
... Change the issue status to _Feedback_
... Change the "Assignee" field to blank
... Keep the workspace in case the OneFact team needs further data from it
.._NOTE_ A chain like, Subsystem::TestClass::ArrayTest, is meant to be followed
by expanding or double-clicking the leftmost element to see the next element to
the right.

=== Tips and Tricks

* Add the *models* repository to the BridgePoint git perspective.
** When the test instructions say to use a model, as in step 1 of the Test
   Instructions in the <<QA Manual Test Example Page>> screenshot, import a 
   project from the *models* repository with a matching name. e.g., "ex2"
*** In finding the project, there is a minor annoyance with the <<presented
    import screen>> in that all the projects are selected. Select
    *Deselect all* before typing in the search field, or all the
    (hidden by the search selection) projects remain selected; selecting
    *Finish* with all the projects selected will cause
    *_all the projects to get imported_*.
** After importing the project, switch back to the _xtUML Modeling_ perspective,
   to see the project.

* When deleting a project from BridgePoint, a dialog will be presented with a
  checkbox labeled, "Delete project contents on disk (cannot be undone)". This
  should remain unselected for projects imported from the *models* repository,
  but even if accidentally selected, it can be recovered by removing changes to
  the repository. e.g., 'git reset HEAD --hard'
* The <<QA Manual Test Example Page>> screenshot, shows a typical test
  procedure. The expected result of a test step is in the box below it.
* Sometimes Verifier will fail to launch the first time. Just launch Verifier
  again. If it fails a second time, contact OneFact support.
